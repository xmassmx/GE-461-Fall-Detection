# GE-461-Fall-Detection

Hi, 

This repository contains my work for the fourth project of the GE-461: Introduction to Data Science course. 

In this project, we are  implementing classification on sensor data in order to classify if there has been a fall action or a non-fall action. 
Initially, we use  unsupervised  learning  methods in  order  to  visualize the dataset.
Then  we  use  two classification algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), in order to classify the data.
